# ShortCircuit
Short Circuit is a collection of AutoCAD Tinkercad circuit designs created as part of my undergraduate coursework at Sister Nivedita University (SNU), along with additional hobby circuits developed for experimentation and learning.

## Circuits
### 1. DE-AND-GATE
A simple 2-input AND gate circuit made with a breadboard. Includes two versions — one using a logic IC and another built purely from basic components to show how the logic works internally.

### 2. DE-OR-GATE
A 2-input OR gate circuit implemented on a breadboard. Includes two versions — one using a logic IC and another using discrete components to demonstrate the logic from scratch.

### 3. DE-XOR-GATE
An XOR gate circuit demonstrating exclusive OR logic. Includes two versions — one with an IC for compact implementation and another assembled from basic components to help understand the inner workings.
